# PIC16F877A RTC with DS1307 and LCD16x2

This project demonstrates how to interface a **PIC16F877A microcontroller** with the **DS1307 Real-Time Clock (RTC)** using the **I2C protocol**.  
The system displays the current **time** and **date** on a **16x2 LCD**.  
The project was developed using **MPLAB IDE with XC8 compiler** and tested in **Proteus simulation software**.

## üìå Features
- Displays **Time** in `HH:MM:SS` format.
- Displays **Date** in `DD:MM:YY` format.
- Uses **I2C communication** between PIC16F877A and DS1307 RTC.
- LCD16x2 interface in **8-bit mode**.
- Written in **embedded C (XC8)** with modular, easy-to-read code.
- Fully **simulated in Proteus** before hardware implementation.

## üîó Pin Connections

| Component       | Pin on PIC16F877A | Notes                       |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| DS1307 SDA      | RC4 (SDA)        | I2C Data line (with pull-up) |
| DS1307 SCL      | RC3 (SCL)        | I2C Clock line (with pull-up)|
| LCD RS          | RC2              | Control pin                  |
| LCD EN          | RC1              | Enable pin                   |
| LCD             | RD0 - RD7        | Data pins (8-bit mode)       |
| VCC, GND        | +5V, GND         | Power supply                 |

## üìú Code Overview
- **main.c**  
  Initializes peripherals, reads time/date from DS1307, and displays them on LCD.  
---

## üîß How It Works
1. **Initialization**  
   - I2C is initialized at 100 kHz.  
   - LCD is initialized in 8-bit mode.  

2. **RTC Communication**  
   - DS1307 continuously keeps track of time and date.  
   - PIC16F877A communicates with DS1307 over I2C to fetch updated time/date values.  

3. **Display**  
   - The fetched data is converted into ASCII format.  
   - Time is displayed on the **first line of the LCD**.  
   - Date is displayed on the **second line of the LCD**.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Simulation in Proteus
- The Proteus file (`rtc_lcd.pdsprj`) simulates the circuit.  
- LCD will show live **time** and **date**.  
- You can adjust DS1307 registers to test different times/dates.
